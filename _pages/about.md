About Me
======
I received the B.E. degree in communication engineering and the M.E. degree in information and communication engineering from the Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT), China, in 2018 and 2020, respectively. After graduation, I have been a remote research assistant supervised by [Prof. Vishal Monga](http://signal.ee.psu.edu/faculty.html) on interpretable deep learning with strong interests and foundation in mathematics. My current research interests include signal and image processing, interpretable machine learning and applications. Currently, I am pusuring PhD degree at Nanyang Technology University, supervised by [Prof. Tay Wee Peng](https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/wptay/TayWeePeng.html) on the signal processing and machine learning. I feel very lucky that I have many opportunities to explore my interested areas.

Experience updates
======
* January 2023: I receive the PhD research scholarship from [Nanyang Techology Univeristy](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/), supervised by [Prof. Tay Wee Peng](https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/wptay/TayWeePeng.html), and start my PhD journey at Singapore!
* March 2022: I receive the PhD offer from [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/) with Three-Year MEDA Fellowship, supervised by [Prof. Mark Coates](http://www.ece.mcgill.ca/~mcoate/)ÔºÅ(However, my study permit is stuck into a long security check....)
* June 2021: I am sad to hear from the newly issued Proclamation 10043, USA, which prohibits students in HIT and other many universities to obtain a valid F visa!
* July 2020: My master dissertation is ranked as the Excellent Graduation Thesis!
* March 2020: I am lucky to receive the Ph.D Fellowship offers from [Penn State University, USA](https://www.psu.edu/), supervised by [Prof. Vishal Monga](http://signal.ee.psu.edu/faculty.html)! Looking forward to the life in Penn State!
